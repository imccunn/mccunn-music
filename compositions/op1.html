	<p class="description">This peice was written early in my time studying composition at WWU. At the time, I was studying the works George Crumb whose works feature percussion and use of the piano in a percussive way. Here I explored some of those techniques such as depressing keys silently in order to strum particular strings of the piano and plucking the strings of piano. Additionally, this was my first expirementation with slightly non-standard percussion instruments like crystal glasses which create beautiful tones when tuned with water and their edges rubbed with the fingers.</p>
